This program allows you to plan your workday. Use the slider handles above to set either your preferred start time OR your preferred end time and the text below will auto-populate with your scheduled work day. The default is set from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM assuming a one hour lunch.

---In Development---
To manage your break time, first check if your break is included in your work day (9 hours total, 1 hour lunch, default option) or not (8 hours total). Then enter your break start time and it will be added to your schedule.

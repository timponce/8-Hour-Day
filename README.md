This program allows you to plan your workday. Enter either your preferred start time OR your preferred end time and the start and end times will auto populate to give you your 8 hour work day. To manage your break time, first check if your break is included in your work day (8 hours total) or not (8:30 total). Then enter your break start time and it will be added to your schedule.
